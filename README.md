I converted XInput from VB .NET to C#.



## Things to watch out for when converting from VB .NET to C#


### 1. DLL Imports:

Pay attention to the syntax when importing DLLs in VB .NET and C#.

**Example:**

VB .NET Syntax:

```vb

<DllImport("XInput1_4.dll")>
Private Shared Function XInputGetState(dwUserIndex As Integer, ByRef pState As XINPUT_STATE) As Integer
End Function

```

C# Syntax:

```csharp

[DllImport("XInput1_4.dll")]
private static extern int XInputGetState(int dwUserIndex, ref XINPUT_STATE pState);

```

In C#, attributes are defined using ```[]``` square brackets, while VB .NET uses ```<>``` angle brackets. C# employs ```extern``` to indicate external functions, whereas VB .NET uses ```Shared``` . The parameter passing also differs: C# uses ```ref``` , while VB .NET uses ```ByRef``` .




### 2. Structs:

Pay attention to the syntax when defining structs in VB .NET and C#.

**Example:**

C# Syntax:


```csharp

public struct XINPUT_STATE
{
    public int dwPacketNumber;
    public GamePadState GamePadState;
}

```



VB .NET Syntax:

```vb

Public Structure XINPUT_STATE
    Public dwPacketNumber As Integer
    Public GamePadState As GamePadState
End Structure

```

In C#, the ```struct``` keyword is followed by the struct name and its members are defined within curly braces ```{}```. In VB .NET, the ```Structure``` keyword is used, and members are defined with their types following the ```As``` keyword, enclosed within ```End Structure``` . 





### 3. Boolean Values:

Pay attention to the syntax when defining and using boolean values in conditions.

**Example:**

VB .NET Syntax:

```vb .NET

Dim isConnected As Boolean = True  ' Defining a boolean value

If isConnected Then                  ' Using the value in a condition
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is connected!")
Else
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is not connected.")
End If

```


C# Syntax:



```c#


bool isConnected = true;            // Defining a boolean value

if (isConnected)                    // Using the value in a condition
{
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is connected!");
}
else
{
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is not connected.");
}

```




In VB .NET, you use ```Dim``` for declaration, while in C#, you declare with the type directly. Additionally, C# requires ```()``` parentheses around the condition in the ```if``` statement.
