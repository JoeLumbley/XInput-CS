I converted XInput from VB .NET to C#.



## Things to watch out for when converting from VB .NET to C#.

### 5. Boolean Values:

Pay attention to the syntax when defining and using boolean values in conditions.

**Example:**

VB .NET Syntax:

```vb .NET

Dim isConnected As Boolean = True  ' Defining a boolean value

If isConnected Then                  ' Using the value in a condition
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is connected!")
Else
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is not connected.")
End If
```


C# Syntax:



```c#


bool isConnected = true;            // Defining a boolean value

if (isConnected)                    // Using the value in a condition
{
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is connected!");
}
else
{
    MessageBox.Show("Controller is not connected.");
}
```




This example highlights the syntax differences in defining boolean values and using them in conditions. In VB .NET, you use Dim for declaration, while in C#, you declare with the type directly. Additionally, C# requires parentheses around the condition in the if statement. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for a smooth conversion.
